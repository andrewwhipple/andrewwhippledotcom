# Podcasts

I like podcasts a lot. A heck of a lot. And so I made one. It's called "proFUN!dity" and it's a pop culture show where I sit down and talk into a microphone for half an hour every week about something in pop culture I want to talk about. 

...

Yep. That's it. That's the whole show.

You can find it and subscribe to it on [iTunes](/profundity), via this [RSS link](https://feeds.feedburner.com/profunditypodcast) and on the [That Podcast Thing](https://thatpodcastthing.com) network (a pseudo-network started to host a forthcoming podcast with me and my friend Rachel Perry that I just glommed my other show onto to save hosting costs.)

I also took a class on narrative non-fiction radio/podcast production, so I have at least a little bit of experience producing (beginner-quality) pieces in your NPR storytelling vibe. I don't like that kind of stuff, but I can do it. Kinda. 

The final piece for that class uses a bunch of music that super wasn't cleared by anyone (yay making things for class! Fair use-ish.) That's only relevant because it means I can't in good conscience (or sound legal reasoning) post it online and distribute it. But if you're someone who wants to give me a radio-type job and wants it as a sample, absolutely I'll send it your way if you [hit me up](/about).
