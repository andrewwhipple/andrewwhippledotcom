# Programming Stuff

I like to program from time to time, especially web development, and especially in Javascript. 

(Yes I know Javascript is a garbage language, but it's a garbage language that I kinda know and lets me make web stuff, which I like.)

I've run up against these languages during the last few years of school-and-side-projects programming, but full disclosure, I am very bad at remembering specifics of particular languages and libraries, so to call me super "familiar" with any of them may be a stretch. (But give me a few days with a language spec and I'll figure it out, probably.)

* Javascript
* Coffeescript
* HTML
* CSS
* Python
* C
* C++
* ChucK
* Swift
* Java (literally four years ago though so like...)

### Projects:


***This Blog Engine***

To flex Node.js chops, and because both my old site crashed and there doesn't seem to exist a self-hosted CMS that uses Dropbox to store Markdown that turns into pages, I made the engine that runs this thing. It...works? But roughly. And technically it's available and open source but like use at your own risk y'all.

The major motivation guiding the design is to have a semi-static, simple-ish CMS that could use Dropbox (or any other folder-based file-syncinc software) as a store for Markdown files that will eventually turn into the pages. I like writing in Markdown, and I don't want to ever deal with an admin panel or entering things on a website to make a new post. I just want to write a Markdown file, drop it in a folder, and have my site work fine (especially so I can edit and post on mobile easily.) And that's what this does. 

(Also my old site couldn't do link posts, and this can.)


***[Meowgic Matt](https://github.com/andrewwhipple/MeowgicMatt)***

This is a set of Python command-line tools to speed up some podcasting workflows, including making and updating an RSS feed, down-rezzing mp3s for publishing, and general file organization. Also open-source, but again made for me and works for me, so your mileage may vary.

***[Snavascript](https://github.com/andrewwhipple/snavascript)***

Dumb, dumb, dumb stupid joke thing.
