# Education

I'm about to finish up a Bachelor of Science in [Symbolic Systems](http://symsys.stanford.edu) from Stanford University, with a Minor in Creative Writing. I currently have a 3.84 GPA, and we'll see what one more quarter can do to that.

I've taken a bunch of classes in a lot of areas, including:

* Computer Science (including Basic Programming, Systems Programming, Theory, Probability, and Web Development)
* Fiction Writing
* Playwriting
* Screenwriting
* Film Studies
* Human-Centered Design
* Psychology/Neuroscience
* Philosophy
* Linguistics
* Radio Production

(I really liked the Writing and Psychology ones, but all of them were pretty good. Except Probability. That was rough.)

I graduated from [Lakeside High School](https://lakesideschool.org) in 2012. I liked it a lot.
