# Writing

I like to write stuff a lot. 

For blog posts and articles and stuff like that, you can find it all [here on this site](/archive). 

I also like to write fiction, particularly plays, film scripts, and short stories.

### Plays

I've written a handful plays, all of which you can read here!

* *[Five Till Places](/static/FiveTillPlaces.pdf)*: A roughly 30-45 minute one-act absurdist comedy about a high school theater tech booth that gets trapped in a time loop (4 women).
* *[Last Page](/static/LastPage.pdf)*: A roughly 30-45 minute one-act absurdist comedy (see a trend?) about a superhero that visits a coffee shop, causing things to go haywire (3 women, 1 man).
* *[A Long Way Down](/static/ALongWayDown.pdf)*: A full-length, two-act dark comedy that is a blatantly illegal adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel *A Long Way Down*, so this is purely posted as a writing sample. Literally would be impossible to ever put on because again, super illegal adaptation.

...And some others that suck.

### Film

I've written a few short film scripts, mostly for a class on adaptations (so again, illegal adaptations that couldn't be made ever, so yay writing samples!)

* *[A Story About You](/static/AStoryAboutYou.pdf)*: A 15-minute adaptation of the episode *A Story About You* from the podcast *Welcome To Night Vale.*
* *[Wolf At The Door](/static/WolfAtTheDoor.pdf)*: A 5-minute adaptation of the Rebecca Curtis short story *Wolf At The Door*.
* *[Bullet In The Brain](/static/BulletInTheBrain.pdf)*: A 5-minute adaptation of the Tobias Woolf short story *Bullet In The Brain*.

### Short Stories

Eh I'm not gonna post these right now. Maybe eventually.
