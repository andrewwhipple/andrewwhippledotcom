# Elsewhere

I live on the internet, more or less. 

Here are social-media-type places you can find me:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewthewhip)
* [Youtube](https://youtube.com/andrewthewhip)
* [Instagram](https://instagram.com/andrewthewhip)
* [Tumblr](https://andrewthewhip.tumblr.com)

Basically if you go to any site and look for the user "AndrewTheWhip," chances are you'll find me.

I also host a couple of [podcasts](/podcast) on the [That Podcast Thing](https://thatpodcastthing.com) network. Creative name, I know.

I make music, which you can find at the Youtube above, and on my [Bandcamp](https://andrewwhipple.bandcamp.com) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/andrewthewhip) pages.

I used to (and still do occasionally, when the mood strikes us) host a super-lo-fi Youtube talk show with my friend Alex Wade called ["The A-Dub Club"](https://youtube.com/theadubclub) where we talk about geeky stuff.

Here's my [github link](https://github.com/andrewwhipple) if that's the kind of silliness you're into.

And I'll update this list if I pop up on other friends' podcasts or shows or sites or the like, but for now its pretty much just the stuff above.
