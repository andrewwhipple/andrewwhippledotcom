# Theater

I like theater a fair amount, and have been doing it in various extracurricular capacities for the past eight years.


### StanShakes

In college I did/do a lot of technical work, specifically with the [Stanford Shakespeare Company](https://stanford.shakespeare.edu). Since it's a company structure, it involved doing a little bit of everything. I did however specify in Sound Design, Lighting Design, Directing, Stage Management, and Company Management (as co-Artistic Director for the company.) Here's a list of that little bit of everything (current work is in **bold**).

* **Co-Artistic Director for the 2015-2016 Season**
* **Assistant Stage Manager, *Wars Of The Roses* (May 2016)**
* Lighting Designer, *Anthony & Cleopatra* (Feb 2016)
* Director, *Much Ado About Nothing* (May 2015)
* Assistant Stage Manager, *Lear* (Feb 2015)
* Sound Designer/Assistant Stage Manager, *The Winter's Tale* (May 2914)
* Sound Designer/Assistant Stage Manager/Assitant Lighting Designer, *Henry V* (Feb 2014)
* Monologue Director, *Fall Showcase* (Nov 2013)
* Lighting Designer, *Love's Labour's Lost* (May 2013)
* Assistant Stage Manager, *Othello* (Feb 2013)
* Assistant Lighting Designer *Any Which Way You Like It* (Nov 2012)

Artistic Directing has been a particularly fascinating challenge, particularly dealing with our first ever show (*Wars Of The Roses*) that is co-directed, and is an original adaptation (a heavily abridged combination of *Henry VI, Parts I-III* and *Richard III* into one three-hour show.)

### Writing

I've written a lot for the stage, in classes, independently, and as part of project at Stanford called *Gaieties.* 

#### Gaities:

*Gaieties* is an annual tradition at Stanford, where during the week leading up to our "Big Game" with rival UC Berkeley, students put on a completely new, original, full-length comedy musical. The show almost always features some dastardly Cal students launching a villainous plot, and a team of intrepid Stanford students saving the day through hijinks. It's silly and a lot of fun.

The show for the fall is written every spring by a team of 6-10 undergraduate writers in a writer's room, so it's been a fantastic experience learning how to write a cohesive narrative comedy show collaboratively, and on a fairly quick turnaround (2-3 months to write the book for a 70-90 minute comedy musical!)

I'm currently on the writing staff for the Fall 2016 show, and have been on the staff twice before (in 2013 and 2014.)

#### Other writing:

Copy-and-pasted from the [writing](/writing) page, but here ya are.

* *[Five Till Places](/static/FiveTillPlaces.pdf)*: A roughly 30-45 minute one-act absurdist comedy about a high school theater tech booth that gets trapped in a time loop (4 women).
* *[Last Page](/static/LastPage.pdf)*: A roughly 30-45 minute one-act absurdist comedy (see a trend?) about a superhero that visits a coffee shop, causing things to go haywire (3 women, 1 man).
* *[A Long Way Down](/static/ALongWayDown.pdf)*: A full-length, two-act dark comedy that is a blatantly illegal adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel *A Long Way Down*, so this is purely posted as a writing sample. Literally would be impossible to ever put on because again, super illegal adaptation.

...And some others that suck.


### Acting

I only started playwriting and technical theater in earnest in college, and for all four years of high school I acted exclusively. But that sort of fell off the plate in college, so I haven't acted in a show in two years. But here's a (selected) list of acting credits if you're curious.

* Jimmy, *Almost, Maine*, Stanford (dir. Patty Kim, Spring 2014)

* Witch 1, *Macbeth*, Lakeside School, Seattle (dir. Alban Dennis, Spring 2011)
* Sasha/Ensemble, *Fiddler On The Roof*, Lakeside School, Seattle (dir. Marjery Ziff, Winter 2010)
