# About Andrew

Hi. My name is Andrew Whipple. I do a bunch of things. 

<div class="mw-about-image">![Andrew](/static/aboutphoto.jpg)</div>

I'm a [student](/education) at Stanford for a few more months, and then will be graduating off into the wide world to do Technical Project Management, at least for the near future.

I'm currently in the Bay Area (see Stanford above) and grew up in Seattle, and will be moving to Chicago. Which is where I was born. The wheel has come full circle y'all.

Some stuff I do:

* [Writing](/writing), both essays/blog posts, and fiction (especially playwriting/screenwriting/short fiction)
* [Podcasting](/podcast)
* [Programming](/stuff)
* Project Management (no fancy link for that one)
* Design (sorta. Just good enough to be dangerous.)
* [Theater](/theater)
* [Youtube](https://youtube.com/andrewthewhip) (though not for a while)
* [Music](https://soundcloud.com/andrewthewhip)

If you want to check out any of that stuff, and idk maybe pay me to do any of that stuff for you, click those links and get in touch.

# Contact

You can contact me a whole host of places. The two best are probably:

* [Twitter: @AndrewTheWhip](https://twitter.com/andrewthewhip) (this works best if you want to be friends or have short questions)
* [Email: andrewjameswhipple(AT)gmail(DOT)com](mailto://andrewjameswhipple@gmail.com) (this works best for longer things, and is probably more professional-like)
